    <p>Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Charaka, and Kanad were ancient Indian scientists whose contributions in mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and atomic theory were groundbreaking.

It's crucial to rectify historical biases, appreciate their intellectual legacy, and recognize the profound impact they had on our understanding of the world.</p>
