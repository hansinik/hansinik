  <h1>Aryabhata: Astronomer And Earliest Indian Mathematician</h1>
  <p>Aryabhatta was a fifth-century mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, and physicist. He described the method of denoting big decimal numbers by alphabets. He also found answers to many difficult questions from topics of modern-day Mathematics such as number theory, geometry, trigonometry, and Beejganita also known as algebra. But most importantly, he discovered the number 0. Aryabhatta showed that zero was not only a numeral but also a symbol and a concept. The discovery of zero enabled Aryabhatta to find out the exact distance between the earth and the moon. The discovery of zero also opened up a new dimension of negative numerals.</p>

      <td>Invention of Zero</td>

      <td>Aryabhata proposed that the Earth revolves on its axis. This causes the evident rotation of celestial bodies. He also proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system.</td>

      <td>Trigonometric Functions</td>
      <td>Aryabhata introduced trigonometric functions: sine (jya), cosine (kojya), and versine (utkrama-jya). He provided value tables for these functions.</td>

      <td>Aryabhata described lunar and solar eclipses and suggested ways to forecast them correctly.</td>

      <td>Aryabhata devised an accurate timekeeping method, defined the length of a year, proposed a calendar based on the Earth's rotation around the Sun, and created algorithms for various astronomical calculations.</td>
