        <p>Kanad, sometimes known as Kashyap, was an ancient Indian philosopher and physicist who contributed significantly to atomic theory. He is credited for discovering <em>anu</em> (atoms) and popularising the concept of matter's atomic nature.</p>

        <p>Kanad's atomic theory, which predates comparable theories given by Greek thinkers like Democritus and Leucippus, proposes that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles known as <em>anu</em>. He hypothesised that these <em>anu</em> would unite in various ways to generate larger particles and substances. Kanad's hypothesis also argued that atoms have natural attributes like taste, odour, and colour.</p>
    
        <p>Kanad's grasp of the concept of void (empty space) in connection to atoms was one of his most noteworthy contributions. He proposed that atoms are always in motion.</p>
